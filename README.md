# CS250
Portfolio repository for CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

During this project, I realized that interpreting user needs means making sure the work we plan actually matches what the client or user expects. Creating user stories helped a lot because it forced me to break down needs into specific, clear goals that the team could prioritize and work on. I saw firsthand that when stories were vague, it caused confusion later during testing and development.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development by focusing on small, manageable goals instead of trying to plan everything upfront. Working in short sprints, updating the backlog, and holding regular retrospectives made a big difference during this project. In the future, I want to keep using Agile practices like sprint planning, daily standups, and backlog grooming to stay flexible and ready for changes. Being able to adjust as the project evolves is something I want to carry into real-world development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, asking good questions, and staying flexible when priorities change. I learned that good teamwork is not just about doing your assigned tasks, but about keeping everyone in the loop, and supporting the team’s overall goals. Especially during the pivot in this project, being willing to adapt and adjust based on team feedback made a huge difference in keeping the work on track.
